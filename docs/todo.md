# TODO

- fix issues with `pacman -Sy` (something to do with `pacman-key` in `2-installation.sh`?)
- after `4-reboot.sh`, sign in as root and run `5-post-installation.sh` automatically
- reboot does not work from chroot
- error handling when `source`ing files
- 2.1: select the mirrors
- more error handling in `install.sh`
- consider how scripts will run on their own...? (fd 3 & 4)
